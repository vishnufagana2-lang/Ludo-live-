Ludo Live - Simple static template
Files:
- index.html : main page
- style.css  : styles
- script.js  : simple startGame function

How to use:
1. Unzip the folder.
2. Open index.html in a browser to test locally.
3. Replace the example redirect URL in script.js with your actual game URL.
4. To host online, upload these files to Netlify, Vercel (static), or any static hosting.

Notes:
- This is a starter template for UI only. For real-time multiplayer, payments, and game logic you need a backend (Node.js + Socket.IO + Database).
- If you want, I can add more pages (Login, Wallet, Create Battle) and a basic backend scaffold.
